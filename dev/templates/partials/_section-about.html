<h2 class="section__title section__title--about">About</h2>
<p class="about__intro">I'm a web professional with 14 years of experience building websites.</p>
<p>In those years I have seen the web change and evolve, and I am proud to have been part of the early movement of web designers who championed web standards. During this time, I was heavily influenced by Dave Shea's Zen Garden experiment as well as Dan Cederholm's Simplebits website, as well as his book, Designing with Web Standards. I got hooked on the possibilities with CSS and was lucky enough to have been part of the exciting transition from table layouts to css-based design with two different organizations.</p>
<p>I currently specialize in front-end development as part of Google's Brand Studio EMEA, based in London. In my time with Brand Studio, I have been part of launches in Google for Work, Gmail, Calendar, and the global Google Inbox launch.</p>
